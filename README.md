# updated_portfolio

The purpose of this project was to create an updated and more polished / professional portfolio site.  I decided to use a template, linked here: https://themeforest.net/item/creative-resume-cv-vcard-portfolio/20890728

The new portfolio site includes links to my resume, github and linkedin (in addition to having a more sleek and imo, fun design). 

Future developments:  make the portfolio images do something on hover.
